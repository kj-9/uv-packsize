# Implementation Plan for uv-packsize

This document outlines the steps taken to implement the `uv-packsize` tool, which reports the size of a Python package and its dependencies using `uv`.

## 1. Initial Setup and Understanding

*   **Analyzed existing project structure:** Reviewed `uv_packsize/cli.py` to understand the `click` CLI setup and identified the placeholder `command`.
*   **Attempted to analyze reference tool:** Tried to access `https://github.com/qertoip/python-package-size/blob/main/python_package_size/main.py` but it was unavailable. Proceeded with a general approach based on the user's request.

## 2. Core Logic Implementation in `uv_packsize/cli.py`

*   **Modified `cli.py`:**
    *   Replaced the placeholder `first_command` with a new `size_command`.
    *   The `size_command` now accepts `package_name` as a `click.argument`.
    *   Removed the irrelevant `-o` option.
*   **Added necessary imports:** Imported `subprocess`, `tempfile`, `shutil`, `os`, and `sys` for managing temporary directories, running shell commands, and path manipulation.
*   **Implemented `get_dir_size` helper function:** A utility function to recursively calculate the total size of a directory.
*   **Implemented `size_command` logic:**
    *   **Temporary Directory Creation:** Used `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` to create a isolated environment for `uv` operations.
    *   **Virtual Environment Creation:** Executed `uv venv <venv_dir>` to create a new virtual environment within the temporary directory.
    *   **Package Installation:** Used `uv pip install --root <venv_dir> <package_name>` to install the target package and its dependencies into the created virtual environment.
    *   **Site-packages Discovery:** Dynamically located the `site-packages` directory within the virtual environment by walking the `venv_dir`.
    *   **Package Size Calculation:** Iterated through the contents of the `site-packages` directory, calculated the size of each package (directory) using `get_dir_size`, and stored the results.
    *   **Result Reporting:** Printed the package sizes in a human-readable format (MB), sorted by size in descending order.
    *   **Cleanup:** The `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()` context manager ensures automatic cleanup of the temporary directory.

## 3. Code Quality and Documentation

*   **Ran `make sync`:** Synchronized the development environment and created `uv.lock`.
*   **Ran `make check`:** Executed formatting, linting, and type checking.
    *   Addressed `ruff` linter warnings (B007) by renaming unused loop variables (`dirnames` to `_dirnames`, `files` to `_files`) in `get_dir_size` and `size_command`.
    *   Ensured all checks (ruff, ty, pytest) passed.
*   **Updated `README.md`:** Ran `make readme` to regenerate the help message in `README.md`, reflecting the new `size` command.

## 4. Next Steps (Post-Implementation)

*   **Testing:** The user can now test the `uv-packsize size <package_name>` command.
*   **Further Enhancements:** Potential future enhancements could include:
    *   Adding options for output format (e.g., JSON).
    *   Allowing analysis of local packages.
    *   More detailed dependency tree visualization.
    *   Handling different Python versions.
